# Data Structure Animations - Weiss

This is a collection of algorithm animations for a Java-based Data Structures and Algorithms course
(developed for the web course offering of CS361 from Old Dominion University, Norfolk Virginia).


The animations are developed using the [AlgAE animation engine](https://github.com/sjzeil/AlgAE). 

---

Current status:   Code has been copied from a much earlier C++-based collection, and
is being gradually replaced with new Java-based animations reflecting a change in the
course programming language.
